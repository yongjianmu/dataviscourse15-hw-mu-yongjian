*Due: Friday, October 23, 11:59 pm. Value: 6%*


This homework consists of your final project proposal. You can find details about the project proposal on the [course website](http://dataviscourse.net/2015/project/). Your proposal consists of two parts:

1. The project data form that can be [filled out here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/10_uzWOpvTLqs4759WBeZagp-Ig7J6fLKYtDM8Y2Juvw/viewform).
2. The proposal document, [see guidelines](http://dataviscourse.net/2015/project/#proposal).

You may only fill out the project data form **once per team**. You must submit your (identical) proposal document **once per person**. Put the project proposal in a file *proposal_lastname1_lastname2_lastname3.pdf* in your git repository. We will judge the proposal document based on its content and document quality, so please use full sentences, correct grammar and include Figures and captions for clarifications.
